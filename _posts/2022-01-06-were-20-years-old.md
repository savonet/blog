title: We're 20 years old!
---

The Liquidsoap project turned 20 years old this year, if one can believe the copyright assignments in the code.. ðŸ˜¬

This is a pretty wild milestone so it felt it was time to also bring back a good ol' blast from the past: a _blog_!

Indeed, ith the multiplication of online platforms these past years, one can feel hard pressed to find reliable information
about a specific topic or project. Old and new social media websites, the gazilion of
available chat software and the mailing lists still lurking in the background (not to mention the google groups, is that
still a thing?), where should one go?

With this blog, we hope to share bits and pieces of what is going on with the project, recent developments, tings we've learned
user feedbacks etc.

One could hope that this those many years we should have some relevant things to say.. ðŸ˜…

Meanwhile, you can re-watch David's awesome presentation about the early days of the project from our first [Liquidshop](http://www.liquidsoap.info/liquidshop/1/):
